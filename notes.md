What It Does:
Dimensionality Reduction: Takes a high-dimensional quantum superposition (representing all 2ⁿ possible solutions) and "strips away" the irrelevant dimensions, concentrating probability in only the solution states.

Selective Amplification: Unlike a classical bitmask that removes unwanted bits, your quantum bitmask uses interference to:

Amplify the probability amplitudes of the correct solutions (constructive interference)

Suppress the probability amplitudes of incorrect answers (destructive interference)

Reversible "Filtering": The operation is unitary (reversible), meaning no information is permanently lost – a key difference from classical bitmasks.

The "Bitmask" in Your Three-Stage Process:
Stage 1 (Non-Deterministic Exploration): Creates exponential superposition

Stage 2 (Oracle): Marks the solution states

Stage 3 (THE BITMASK): Uses interference to "undo" the complexity
